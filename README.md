# GT-MP-Chatlog-Extractor
Extracts chatlines from GT-MP .log files, placing them into a separate chatlog file.

## Usage
1) Place GT-MP Chatlog Extractor.exe into folder containing logs you wish to convert to chatlogs.
2) Run GT-MP Chatlog Extractor.exe. In v1.0, this will convert every recognised gamelog that includes chatlines in the folder to chatlogs.

*Optional:* create separate folder and drag the files you wish to convert in alongside the .exe to avoid converting gamelogs that are already converted.
