# GT-MP-Chatlog-Extractor
Extracts chatlines from GT-MP .log files, placing them into a separate chatlog file.

## Installation
### Compatibility
This script is designed for Windows platforms.
### Installation Instructions
1) Download from [releases](https://github.com/charlw/GT-MP-Chatlog-Extractor/releases).
2) Unzip GT-MP Chatlog Extractor from 'GT-MP Chatlog Extractor.zip'. Place folder wherever you like, for convenience you can place it into \Grand Theft Multiplayer\logs.
3) Do not move any files out from the GT-MP Chatlog Extractor file, as the .exe depends on these to run.

## Usage
1) Place any chatlogs you wish to convert into your GT-MP Chatlog Extractor folder.
2) Run GT-MP Chatlog Extractor.exe. In v1.0, this will convert every recognised gamelog that includes chatlines in the folder to chatlogs.
